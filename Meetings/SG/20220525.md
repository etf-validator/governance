## Status of ETF release

- Repositories were restructured according to EIP [#70](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70):
  - now there is one repository for the webapp + repositories for each test driver.

- GitHub Actions were introduced.

- A draft release was created: https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/releases/tag/2.1.0-rc.1

- Testing of the RC by the JRC highlighted a redirection issue caused by the new version of Xerces:
  - this is due to the specific architecture/limitations at the Commission level, ii does not have the same needs;
  - the JRC will investigate what are the possible options to avoid or address the problem internally, but this is not a blocking issue for the ETF release.

- Next steps:
  - [ ] JRC to make a build with the RC and confirm that we can proceed with the release
  - [ ] ii to produce a list of all changes for the changelog: functionality (EIPs), bugfixes and security fixes
  - [ ] JRC to update the documentation on GitHub, starting with the admin one
  
- After the release, it is proposed to discuss about a roadmap for future releases.
  - [ ] All to rediscuss about the roadmap in the next meeting.
