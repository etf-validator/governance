## Status of ETF release

* JRC confirms the deployment issue about the missing JAR libraries, to be taken into account in the release/documentation process.

- [x] JRC and contractors to send to Jon: the JAR files produced, the stack trace of the missing dependencies and the compilation instructions.

- [x] Jon to compare the files with those produced by the GitHub pipeline.

- [x] JRC contractors to update the [ETF documentation](https://github.com/etf-validator/docs/tree/master/v2.1) for the release (see the related [pull request](https://github.com/etf-validator/docs/pull/8)).

- [x] Jon to proceed with the release of ETF v.2.1.0, possibly before [FOSS4G 2022](https://2022.foss4g.org/) where [a presentation on the ETF](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/Q78RAS/) will take place.

* The [release](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/releases/tag/2.1.0) happened on August 19:
  - an overview of the overall build status was added to the [ETF organisation landing page](https://github.com/etf-validator#components)
  - all the [issues](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/milestone/6?closed=1) and [EIPs](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/milestone/1?closed=1) corresponding to the release were closed

- [ ] After the release, SG to discuss a plan for future ETF releases.


## HTTP/HTTPS redirection in ETF

* Following the discussion from the last SG meeting, an [EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/116) to allow HTTP-HTTPS redirection was prepared. It is approved by the SG and added to the [EIP project board](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/) under _SG:discussion_.

* the SG confirms that the redirection should be configurable in the ETF and only allowed if the protocol changes, but the rest of the URL remains identical.

- [ ] contractors to create a pull request that implements the change.


## ETF & OSGeo

- **OSGeo Community Project**: 
  - still no news on the application process, which requires the approval of the OSGeo Incubation Committee and finally of the OSGeo Board.

- **OSGeoLive**:
  * a RC version of the OSGeoLive will be provided before [FOSS4G 2022](https://2022.foss4g.org/) (including the status of [translations](https://www.transifex.com/osgeo/osgeolive/) as of this week), but the final version v.15 will be only released in September. 
  - [x] contractors to make tests as soon as the RC is published and report issues, if any.
  * further changes to the ETF overview and quickstart were made (see [pull requests](https://github.com/OSGeo/OSGeoLive-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajenriquesoriano)).


## Change in the OGC TEAM Engine

* Credentials were created for the staging and production instances of the INSPIRE Reference Validator as well as for the OSGeoLive version of the ETF (where WFS tests make use of the TEAM Engine).

* The OGC confirmed that the authentication will be also incorporated in the production instance of the TEAM Engine between end of September and end of December, hence implementing the change in the ETF v.2.0 becomes urgent.

- [ ] contractors to make a pull request.
 
 
## AOB

- **FOSS4G 2022 presentation on the ETF**:
  * Jon shared the draft slides with Marco, who made some first comments.
  - [x] Jon and Marco to finalise the presentations before the conference.

- **Next meeting**: 13/09/2022, 11:00-12:30 CEST
  - [x] Marco to send an invite.
