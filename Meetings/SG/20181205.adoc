== Minutes of previous meeting and open actions

The minutes of the previous 6th SG meeting were accepted.

=== ETF licensing option

JRC had an additional discussion with their IPR unit on the possibility of licensing
ETF under EUPL conditions, complemented by the Developer Certificate of Origin
mechanism. The EC is fine with the DCO conditions. The outcomes
have been summarized by Marco https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/21#issuecomment-444087409[here].

The contributors do not become owners and there is no need to mention or list
them in the copyright. The SG would be fine with the EUPL+DCO. For now, the
copyright will stay as it is. Later 'and the ETF contributors' could be added.

JRC will discuss whether their contractors sign the DCO or if source code is
published by JRC. ii will discuss with the german mapping agency AdV whether they
need to make a direct contribution to ETF and how this could be handled in the
current project.

JRC will examine how the DCO signing process could look like. ii will then
implement the changes. The SG must be able to keep track of all DCOs.

**Actions**:

- JRC to check the DCO signing process
- ii will implement the changes for the DCO
- JRC to move forward with a statement of the EC about the EUPL

=== Expectations regarding technical support by the TC

There is nothing to discuss regarding technical support.

=== EIP workflow

The SG agreed on the updated https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/2[EIP project board].
Since externals do not have the rights to tag and move EIPs in the project board,
the SG agreed to observe the repository and manually tag and move EIPs.

JRC will review proposals that were opened in
INSPIRE validation https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/blob/master/README.md[community repository] and
open new EIPs in the ETF governance repository.

**Actions**:

- ii to update the process steps described in the Readme of PR https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/53[#53]
- SG to review the PR

=== Bug fixes, the workflow and permissions on project

The contributors do not see the project board. The have announced two bug fixes
in the issues https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/177[#177] and https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/178[#178] .

SG agreed that the review procedure of bug fixes is similar to the EIP
procedure. Bug fixing contributions must be made in separate PRs before they
can be reviewed.

**Actions**:

- ii to publish project board
- ii to add information about the bug fixing workflow to the Readme
- JRC contractors to create separate PRs
- ii to add bug fixing PRs to the bug fixing project board, once they have been created

=== EIPs for SG discussion

No new EIPs. EIP https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/44[#44] waits for feedback by the JRC contractors.

JRC reports increased user interest in two proposals from the INSPIRE validation community repository:

* https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/6[Show conformance class dependencies to users]
* https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/7[Improving the way test reports are searched and found]

**Actions**:

- JRC contractors to review the last comment of EIP https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/44[#44]

=== Release of ETF 2.0.0

The release process is time-consuming as there are no automated tests. JRC
will discuss with their contractors ideas how automated testing could be realised
and create a proposal.

**Actions**:

- ii to release ETF 2.0.0
- JRC to create a proposal for automated tests

== AOB
