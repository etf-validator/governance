Actions regarding EIPs [75](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/75),
[31](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/31) and [60](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/60) are still open 
(work by contractors is in progress).

All remaining actions have either been completed or are discussed and updated today.

## EIPs for SG discussion

- [#61](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61): 
  - Contractors provided [a mockup](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61#issuecomment-505391033) showing manual tests 
  in green with a user icon.
  - It is decided again to use the same green color of passed tests (the only difference will be the icon).
  - It is agreed to change the label to 'EIP-approved' and move it to 'TC: in release planning'. 
  
- [#77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77): 
  - ii had a urgent need for this, but then a quick solution to solve the problem was found.
  - The problem will be addressed in September/October and the plan is to use Groovy as scripting language.
  - It is agreed to keep this EIP in the agenda for the next meetings.

## EIPs in release planning

- [32](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32)
  - little feedback on how to improve the search for tags and change the UI was received from the sub-group (see [here](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/7#issuecomment-505344360)).
  During the last meeting (17/7) a new request for feedback was made.

## Status of open PRs

- [189](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/189):
  - [ ] Contractors to add automatic tests using Nightwatch, then inform the TC.
  
- [193](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/193): 
  - [ ] Contractors to address Jon's requests.
  
- [203](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/203): 
  - [ ] Contractors to solve Codacy issues.
  
- [196](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/196):
  - the PR was merged, but Jon noticed afterwards that the Rerun button does not work if the test object has been cleaned
  up and no longer exists.
  - A [PR to revert the previous PR](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/206) is available, but should not be needed since the fix should be easy.
  - [ ] Contractors to provide a bugfix in a new PR.
  
## Plan for automated tests for the next releases of ETS/ETF

  - It is agreed to use Nightwatch tests for any new change that has impacts on the UI.
  - It is agreed to keep this topic in the agenda of future meetings.
  
## AOB

- The [INSPIRE validator](http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/validator/) (deployed in the cloud) has had the same clean-up problem already experienced
before in the sandbox: test objects are not properly cleaned up and are causing issues in terms of disk space. A temporary patch was applied
to fix this. This behavior does not happen on the instance run by ii, so it should be a bug.
  - [ ] Contractors to investigate the problem and open a bugfix issue.

- An issue that came up in the 2017.4 sub-group meeting on 17/7 was the authoritative location of ISO code lists, since people are
using multiple locations and it is not clear (also after discussing this with ISO) what is the correct one.

- A workshop on the INSPIRE validator (including the ETF) is planned for October 1-2:
  - first day will be for users, second day for developers (to show e.g. how to use/extend the ETF API and how to extend ETS)
  - a [survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/Validator-Workshop) was launched to collect expressions of interest (deadline: July 31); final agenda will be available in August.
  
- ii will not attend FOSS4G 2019, while Guadaltel/Geograma will attend; Marco will share a draft of the FOSS4G presentation in August

- a draft of ISO/CD 19105 (including information on the ETF and INSPIRE in an annex) was published and is available for comments until 2/9.
Both ii and JRC plan to comment.

- Next meeting: September 3 at 10:00
  - [x] JRC to share Webex invitation
