## Minutes of previous meeting and open actions

- [Minutes by ii](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/blob/master/Meetings/SG/20200121.md) accepted and merged.
- All open actions are on the agenda today, except those on EIPs [#76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76) and [#49](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/49) where there are no news. These should be re-discussed at the next meeting.

## Cleanup issue on the JRC Validator instance

- As reported in [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208), the JRC is experiencing ETF performance issues during the massive validation of metadata for the Monitoring 2019 process:
  - performance decreases quickly when the number of TestRuns and TestObjects increases;
  - a BaseX exception occurs when deleting TestRuns and TestObjects using the API;
  - the manual cleanup operation is still used as a workaround;
- A feature request from the AdV is foreseen for the next months and could help solve the issue.
- [ ] Contractors to continue the experiment and share anything that can be helpful.


## EIPs for SG discussion

- [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)
  - ii updated the EIP with the description of:
    - the limitations of SoapUI, which is the reason for the need of a new test driver;
    - the proposed solution to use a DSL based on a Given-When-Then pattern (precondition-action-validation);
  - ii is developing a prototype for some WFS profiles of the German Surveying Authorities; tests on the INSPIRE profiles (which are not too different) might be migrated as well;
  - the JRC has recently developed a [draft specification document for INSPIRE Download Services based on OGC API - Features](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features): this new test driver would be the natural choice to develop a dedicated ETS in the future;
  - [ ] ii to keep the SG updated on the development of the test driver.

- [EIP #70](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70)
  - ii updated the EIP with the proposed restructuring of the ETF repositories in view of the next release:
    - the webapp remains separate from the core, so that it is not necessarily included in the release;
    - a new repository is created for the BaseX test driver, which includes the updated geometry, topology and schema capabilities; it is required to see which changes are needed to the test driver to upgrade to the new BaseX version;
  - the EIP is approved and moved into _in release planning_.

- [EIP #87](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/87)
  - As agreed in the last SG meeting, ii created a dedicated EIP for this.
  - The client is a wrapper for the ETF API written in Java, focused on a simplified workflow.
  - It is agreed to move the repository under the ETF organization, since it is part of the same ecosystem.
    - [x] ii to move the Java client repository under the ETF organization.
  - The EIP is approved, moved into _implemented_ and closed.


## ETF release plan & process (including automated tests)

- The next release of the ETF will be the last one based on Java 8:
  - as discussed above, the ETF webapp will be decoupled from the release;
  - the draft EIPs opened by ii to be/be not included in the next release are discussed [here](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/teams/sg/discussions/19) and [here](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70#issuecomment-590856441);
  - all the draft EIPs opened by the JRC will not be included in the release.
- The idea is to still have manual tests for the next release, and move to CI in the future:
  - ii shows a demo of a data-driven testing approach, organized into directories for each tests, with test data, test specification, and expected outcome;
  - the main idea is to run the tests against the current version and the draft release, and then compare the two using JSON files generated automatically from the test reports;
  - [ ]  ii to create and share a small documentation of the JSON, so that everyone can then start collecting datasets to be used in the automated tests.
- There is not a fixed deadline for the next release, but May/June is the target.


## Governance of the webapp

- Both ii and the JRC are working on the development of their custmized interface;
  - the JRC set the deadline for the first prototype for the [INSPIRE Conference 2020](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conference2020) in May.
- It is agreed to keep the topic open for discussion at the next meeting.


## Status of open PRs for bug fixes

- [ ] Contractors to check [PR #189](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/189)
- [ ] Contractors to provide a bugfix for [issue #209](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/209)


## AOB

- [EIP #21](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/21)
  - the JRC updated the EIP with the link for downloading the Commission Decision to publish the ETF code under EUPL.
  - [x] JRC to share the draft document with the SG and close the issue.

- Docker image
  - [x] Carlos to change the name of the maintainer of the Docker image in the next release of INSPIRE Reference Validator.

- CRS issue on GML validation
  - Contractors made a first [PR](https://github.com/deegree/deegree3/pull/1034) to solve the [issue](https://github.com/deegree/deegree3/issues/886), the deegree TMC asked for some refactoring.

- List of existing ETF instances
  - FI is also using an ETF instance; they contacted the JRC for some questions on the Validator and were invited to add their instance in the [dedicated list](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/162).

- ETF Validator at the INSPIRE Conference 2020
  - There won't be a separate session on the Validator, but just 3 speed presentations (one by the JRC and two from DE);
  - there will be a workshop organised by Contractors and focused on how to deploy the Validator (including the use of the Docker image); Member States representatives will be invited to attend.

- Next meeting: April 1, 2020 at 10:00
  - [x] JRC to send an invitation
