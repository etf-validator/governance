## Minutes of previous meeting and open actions

- [Minutes by ii](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/blob/master/Meetings/SG/20200910.md) accepted and merged.
- All open actions are on the agenda, except those on the following issues, which will be discussed in a future meeting
  - [EIP #76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76)
  - [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208)

## EIPs for SG discussion

- [EIP 96](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/96)
  - The [existing EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/96) was updated so that it clearly refers to GmlGeoX v.1. The EIP is marked as 'EIP-approved' and moved to 'TC: scheduled for release'.
  - A [PR](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox/pull/26) on the integration of the deegree fix with GmlGeoX v.1 was opened and merged.
  - A [new EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/100) was opened to keep track of the (future) need to also integrate the deegree fix into GmlGeoX v.2. This will be separately addressed after the next ETF release. The EIP is moved to 'SG: discussion'.

- [EIP 77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)
  - The work with the AdV is slowly progressing and there is currently discussion on how to move things forward. A prototype is available, but it is not yet ready.
  - [OGC API - Features as an INSPIRE Download Service](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/) was endorsed as an INSPIRE Good Practice, and one of the next steps - foreseen for early 2021 - will be to develop ETS for it. SoapUI will be used initially, with the option to switch to the new test driver in the future.  
  

## ETF release plan & process

- Testing with the etf-result-checker
  - A [new EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/99) was created to discuss whether the etf-result-checker could support test suites for additional test drivers.
  - It is probably not worth the effort to extend the etf-result-checker to support test suites based on SoapUI.
  - The EIP is moved to 'SG: discussion' so that it can be re-discussed in the next meetings.
  
- Issue with the GML invalid geometries
  - The same approach used for GmlGeoX v.2 should be used in GmlGeoX v.1, i.e. check the GML before passing it to deegree by verifying if there is an inconsistency between the CRS and the SRS dimension. All invalid geometries should be ignored, i.e. not used in any test.
  - The code (which is also the one included in the current RC) is in the [etf-bsxtd repository](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-bsxtd/) under branch [next-3](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-bsxtd/tree/next-3).
  - [X] Carlos to open an [EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/102), where the approach to handle invalid geometries is described. Once this is applied to GmlGeoX v.1, the following step will be to integrate it in GmlGeoX v.2.

- Hotfix due to a change in the OGC TEAM Engine
  - A [hotfix release of the INSPIRE Reference Validator](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/releases/tag/v2020.3.1) was released to incorporate a fix due to a change in the OGC TEAM Engine endpoint used by the Validator, which required to update the TEAM Engine test driver (currently with a workaround).
  - The same fix shall be done at the ETF level and included in the next release.
  - [X] Carlos to open an [issue](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/issues/447) in the OGC TEAM Engine repository, to report the issue and ask feedback.
  - [X] Carlos to make a [PR](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-tetd/pull/4) to the [etf-tetd repository](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-tetd) with the same workaround used for the INSPIRE Reference Validator.
  - [ ] Jon to release the new ETF RC, including:
	 - this fix to the TEAM Engine test driver
	 - the latest INSPIRE ETS
  

## Governance of the webapp

- JRC released the protptype of the new UI in mid-October and open a 1-month testing period where interested users could request access credentials, test the new UI and provide feedback. [Feedback was received by 4 users](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Validator+UI%22).
- JRC is currently analysing the feedbakc received and selecting the changes to apply. The final public release of the new UI is foreseen in early 2021.


## AOB

- Next meeting: December 17, 2020 at 11:00, focused on the ETF release.
  - [X] Marco to send an invitation.
