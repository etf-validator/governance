## Minutes of previous meeting and open actions

- [Draft Minutes by JRC](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/105) are available.
  - [ ] Jon will review the minutes.
  - [ ] Carlos will run a test with a GML file to see, if the [PR](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox/pull/27) for [EIP #102](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/102) has been included in the release candidate.
  - [ ] If not, Jon will provide an update.
- The meeting is focused on the upcoming ETF release; after the release, we will look at the backlog. Hence, discussion on the following issues and EIPs is postponed to a future meeting:
  - [EIP #76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76)
  - [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208)
  - [EIP #100](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/100)
  - [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)
  - [EIP #99](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/99)
  - any additional draft EIPs

## ETF release plan & process

- Status of testing with the RC and schedule for the next release
  - JRC deployed the release candidate in a similar environment as the production instance and checked the inconsistencies reported in the last meeting.
  - WMS test at05 still returns a different response in the release candidate ("ERROR DOCTYPE is disallowed when the feature 'http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl' set to true.") compared to the production validator (exception processed as expected).
    - The response is `<!DOCTYPE ServiceExceptionReport SYSTEM "http://schemas.opengis.net/wms/1.1.1/exception_1_1_1.dtd">`.
    - The reason could be a Xerces security setting.
    - Such cases should be caught so that this is reported not as a system exception, but as a "regular error".
    - [ ] Carlos will investigate how to update the code. Some options:
      - Configuration property to disable the check, e.g. in a local environment
      - Change in SoapUI flow to detect DTD responses and then update the ETS  
    - The reported Atom issue turned out to be a non-issue and was caused by the http/https redirect.

## Security issues in the INSPIRE instance

A security assessment was performed on the INSPIRE Reference Validator. Actions:

- [X] JRC will create a PR to add a configuration parameter to switch off returning a stacktrace in some API responses. Carlos to contact Jon in case of any further questions. (Note: The PR is available at https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/221).

## AOB

- Tests for OGC API - Features in the INSPIRE Validator
  - JRC updated on the progress. The approach is similar to WFS - reuse the OGC CITE tests for conformance with the OGC standard and add additional INSPIRE-specific tests in a new ETS. Several requirements are not tested in CITE tests. JRC will contact OGC, if there are plans to increase the coverage.
- Next meeting
  - Tentative: March 16, 10am CET
  - Both PRs discussed in the meeting should be available, if necessary re-schedule.
  - [ ] Marco to send an invitation once the meeting has been confirmed.
