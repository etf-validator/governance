the formal process for the decision.
* The EIPs will be discussed <<eips,later in the meeting>>.

== Update on INSPIRE validation helpdesk

Users of the INSPIRE Validator find it difficult to identify where to submit issues.
JRC has added a new link:https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/wiki/INSPIRE-validation[repository]
to get input from the community at a single location and have a forum for INSPIRE Validator discussions. JRC and Bilbomatica will look after the repository.

== Membership in the GitHub ETF organisation

Membership of the GitHub ETF organisation will be restricted to members
of the ETF SG and TC. Developers working on ETF updates may be added as
outside collaborators. Once they become, for example, TC members, they will
be invited to become members of the organisation.

== Expectations regarding technical support by the TC

ii expressed concerns that the expectation for technical support by the TC
may exceed what is feasible. There is a steep learning curve for new ETF
developers and one of the work items at JRC is to identify how the developer
documentation could be improved to make it easier to get started for new
developers. The topic should be revisited in a month.

*Action:* Michael to add the topic to the agenda of 6th SG meeting.

== EIPs for SG discussion

* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/48[#48]: Approved.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/44[#44]: It would be good to have numbers how much of an impact this change would have. JRC will update EIP with additional information.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/45[#45]: The reference to ``/home/tomcat/.etf/`` is unclear. JRC will add more details.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/46[#46]: This would affects core functionality and, therefore, needs a more detailed design (what should be changed in the software and how) in order to be discussed. This is related to #48, too.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/47[#47]: See #46. This builds on #46 and adds additional complexity.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/36[#36]: Move to draft as well. As an example Geonovum has some link:https://github.com/Geonovum/etf-test-projects-inspire/tree/master/src[older WMS tests] (using ETF version 1).
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/40[#40]: Move to draft. Explain in an update how is that should be technically achieved. Maybe also discuss with the original submitter / the MIG-T subgroup / the INSPIRE community what characteristics are needed.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/29[#29]: Move to draft. What should be shown to whom? The API provides more detailed link:http://inspire-sandbox.jrc.ec.europa.eu/etf-webapp/v2/status[status information]. In general, it is better to have statements what the status means for the user than the raw figures which may be difficult to interpret.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/30[#30]: There are two solution strategies, either in Java or in JavaScript. Probably better in Java to expose it via the API. Move to revision.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32[#32]: Discuss with the original submitter / the MIG-T subgroup / the INSPIRE community what characteristics are needed. Move to draft.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/28[#28]: Approved.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/26[#26]: Approved. This needs to take any dependency with the cloud support work into account.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/25[#25]: Approved.
* link:https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/17[#17]: Move to draft.

*Action:* ii to add a new EIP for validation against local schema files. We can close #14 afterwards as all sub-items have been moved to specific EIPs.

We also discussed the EIP workflow, it may need some fine-tuning. There was
agreement that we need to distinguish EIPs that express a user need from
those that include a technical proposal for the implementation. For now we
will share the first category ("ideas") as EIP-drafts. If an SG member would
like to have a general discussion, if there are concerns with moving an idea
forward, they can be moved to "ready for discussion" and it will be discussed
in a SG/TC meeting and/or in the GitHub issue.
