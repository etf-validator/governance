## Updates

ii is working on a new Domain Specific Language for testing web services / APIs, but the language can also be used for data tests. A modular structure for tests will be supported. A first release is planned for the end of 2024. Test suites covering multiple test drivers will also be supported. 

JRC regularly releases new versions of the INSPIRE Validator. Updates include performance optimizations for monitoring / reporting, security vulnerability fixes, tests for data-service linking.

The planned survey was not sent out.

## Next meeting

The next meeting will be on 8 July at 11:00.

- [x] JRC to send the invite for the next meeting.
