## Minutes of previous meeting and open actions

- [Minutes by JRC](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/119/commits/832c854d11ba618c29378b9271ea3b25d5d1a0ed) are reviewed after the meeting

Open actions are discussed in the agenda.

## Backport patches for version 2

### Teamengine

- Issues have occurred in the pipeline for the legacy build
- JRC contractors will make a manual release of the legacy version

### GmlGeoX

- It was unclear where the changes could be made since the legacy repository was archived
- Repository was un-archived
- JRC contractors will create a new version 1.3.3 in the etf-gmlgeox legacy repository and change the legacy test driver to use this version

## Security fixes

- A public authority has reported security issues for the old ETF version 2 release
- SG agreed on doing unscheduled releases for security issues
- Since the build process has been automated, the effort for a new 2.1.x version should be lower than before version 2.x

## Docker image

- SG agreed that a generic Docker image would be helpful for the community
- The generic Docker image would also serve as basis for the INSPIRE validator
- The build process should be completely automated in order to keep release efforts low
- There are still open issues (security fixes, layout of the image, etc.) that need to be clarified in the future
- [ ] JRC to investigate the docker build process

`Note for the next meeting: if feasible to implement, we will need an EIP`

## User Interface

- It was proposed that for future versions the UI of the INSPIRE Validator will be used
- The current UI is more aimed at experts who want to have fine granular control over their test runs
- The INSPIRE Validator user interface simplifies the use with ETF and does not require expert knowledge
- Maintenance is facilitated by an isolated repository an module and the independance from the Java solution stack
- The new UI could be integrated into the Docker Image
- [ ] JRC to assess whether this is feasible and how the current style (text, logos, etc.) can be changed for ETF

`Note for the next meeting: if feasible to implement, we will need an EIP`

## EIPs

- [EIP #116 - EntityResolver implementation](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/116) is still work in progress. As part of this work, the JRC Contractors will provide a developer documentation on how to setup IntelliJ IDE for ETF.

   - OSGeoLive 15 has been [published](http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/overview.html) with ETF
