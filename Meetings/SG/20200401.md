## Cleanup issue on the JRC Validator instance

- The mass validation of metadata records is ongoing and assertions are being updated based on discussions with the member states.
- More details have been added in [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208). The contractor will continue to analyse and collect more information.

## EIPs for SG discussion

- [EIP 90](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/90) may also help with [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208). It was decided to move the EIP to status "EIP-accepted" and include the EIP in the next release.
- [EIP 77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77): ii presented an overview of the [architecture](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77#issuecomment-607163737). A prototype is planned for the end of the month, with selected WFS profile test cases. The development takes place in an internal repository of ii as it simplifies the integration with continuous integration and delivery plus the use of Java 11. Once the EIP is accepted and ready for integration, the repository will be moved to the ETF organisation.
  - [ ] ii will provide an update in the next meeting.

No news on EIPs [#76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76) and [#49](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/49).

## ETF release plan & process (including automated tests)

- [ ] ii will complete the documentation of EIPs [49](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/49), [57](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/57), and [59](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/59) before the next meeting for review by the SG.
- ii presented their work on a framework for checking that the execution of tests does not change between different releases, available at https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-result-checker. A demo with the INSPIRE staging instance and a MD 2.0 example file from the community space was shown. For each test object a separate folder has to be created and the test object must be either a zip file or provided as a URL.
  - [ ] ii to create a EIP so that the repository can be moved to the ETF validator organisation.
  - [ ] JRC will review.

## Governance of the webapp

JRC showed a [mockup of the new user interface](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/issues/10#issuecomment-596434462) addressing community feedback and consistent with the visual identity of the European Commission websites.

## Status of PRs for bug fixes

- [PR 189](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/189): no update.
- [issue 209](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/209): no update.
- [issue 215](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/215): It should be a configuration option whether the username appears in the log. There is no preference on the default behaviour.

## AOB

- CRS issue on GML validation: updates
  - The PR has been accepted and should be in the next deegree release. It would be good to have this included in the next ETF release.
- There has been some terminology confusion. For example, https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/packages lists packages "etf-repository" (with references to ATS and ETS in the release notes, it is unclear what an "etf-repository" is) and "inspire-validator" (with no release notes). It was clarified that "inspire-validator" is just a newer version of "etf-repository" and the name was changed since "etf-repository" is not correct. 
  - [ ] JRC will update the descriptions, and where possible package names, to clarify the contents.
  - "ETF release" should only be used to refer to ETF versions released by the ETF SG/TC.
- Next meeting tentatively scheduled for 05/05/2020, 10:00.
  - [ ] JRC to confirm and send an invitation or propose an alternative date.
