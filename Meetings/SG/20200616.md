## EIPs for SG discussion

- [EIP #93](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/93)

  - ii updated the EIP. This improvement allows to both: pre-check the schema before the actual validation to exclude XML data that is not schema valid; and improve schema validation performance by parallelizing threads in case of multiple XML documents, and caching schemas (including dependencies) locally.
  - flag the EIP as 'EIP-accepted' and move it to 'TC: scheduled for release'.

- [EIP #57](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/57)

  - Contractors tested the integration of the new deegree version with the version 1.x of GmlGeoX. All test passed.
  - Changes will be included in the next release.

  - [x] Contractors to create a [Pull Request in the GmlGeoX repository](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox/pull/25)
  - [x] ii to merge the request and integrate into BSX legacy test driver 2.1.0

- [EIP 92](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/92)

  - Contractors reported issues with the test tool
  - ii cannot reproduce this. The tool is used in automated test and is also used by ii's clients.
  - [ ] Contractors to trace the issue (with the debugger or the gradle `-i` switch)
  - [x] ii to move the repository under the ETF organisation

- [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)

  - Discussions are continuing with the client on how this can be integrated into ETF. According to current planning, DSL will not be available this year.
  - DSL could be interesting for potential OGC Features API based tests
  - ii to keep the SG informed of developments and plans

- A first release candiate is planned for the third of July.
