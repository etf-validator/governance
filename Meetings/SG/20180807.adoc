= ETF Steering Group (ETF SG) - 3rd meeting

== Logistics

Location: Webex

Date/Time: 07/08/2018, 10:00-11:45

== Attendance

SG members:

* JRC: Michael Lutz (main), Roberto Sgnaolin / Robert Tomas
* ii: Clemens Portele (main), Jon Herrmann

Observers: 

* JRC: Marco Minghini
* Guadaltel: Carlos Palma, IÃ±aki Diaz de Cerio

== Contributor licence agreement (CLA) - status (JRC) and next steps

JRC requires a Commission Decision to sign the CLA. Roberto will initiate the process. 

The JRC CLA covers also contributions by contractors due to the IPR rules in the
Commission contracts. I.e., from an IPR perspective any contribution under these
contracts is a JRC contribution.

*Action:* JRC will resolve the open comments on the CLA and finalize it. Any European Member State
could be the place of jurisdiction. German law will be used, because main contributors 
so far are from Germany.

Pull Request: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/3

*Action:* ii/JRC to sign the final CLA.

The Commission Decision will take time. How to proceed in the meantime? JRC proposed to
use the existing Commission Decision on the INSPIRE geo-portal as the basis for contributions 
until the specific Decision is available as it covers the distribution of INSPIRE software 
tools under the EUPL.

*Action:* ii to review the Commission Decision on the INSPIRE geo-portal and propose 
a mechanism for accepting contributions in the short term.

== Contribution file & Pull request check list

The proposal was discussed and several changes were agreed:

* Clearly distinguish between bug fixes and improvements. Both are managed as "issues" in 
GitHub, but in different repositories.
* Be explicit about the tests that a contributor has to implement (unit tests) and run 
(unit, integration and system tests run by the Continuous Integration). 
 
*Action:* ii to update the two documents and merge the pull request.

Pull Request: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/15

Based on the lessons we will learn during the upcoming months we will amend the documents.

== Code of conduct

*Action:* JRC to update the document as discussed in the 2nd meeting and then merge the 
pull request.

Pull Request: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/pull/12

== Technical Committee - status (ii) and next steps

ii propose Johannes Echterhoff and Clemens Portele as TC members in addition to 
Jon Herrmann due to their previous contributions to the ETF repositories.

*Action:* ii to document the proposal in https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/9.

The two existing proposals were discussed:

* Jon has reviewed the changes for the "rerun button" 
(https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/62). The current change would not 
address the (not fully documented) intention of the issue. He has created an EIP 
for the change. 
* A second change is simply a change in colours. This could be merged once we have
clarified the process until we have the signed CLAs (see above).

== Improvement proposals - discussion and prioritisation

=== Add a rerun button

Link: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/18

See above. *Action:* JRC to review the EIP and update as necessary.

=== ETF Performance review

Link: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/14

* Regarding schema documents, this is a known limitation in the INSPIRE Validator due 
to the schema parser used by BaseX. See https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/ets-repository/issues/22 
for the INSPIRE Validator issue and https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/85
for the existing ETF issue.
* Parallel execution on the ETS level is an option, but still needs to consider the
system resources, for example to avoid unnecessary swapping of memory, which may result
in lower performance for resource intensive tests. For the typical data/metadata ETS 
it should also be possible to parallelise the execution of test assertions as they are
often atomic.
* Caching/loading of Test Suites in memory could be a configuration option.

*Action:* TC to review options and report back to SG.

=== Support to cloud deployment

Link: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/13

*Action:* TC to review options for cloud-native storage options for test objects, reports, 
attachments, etc. and report back to SG.

*Action:* Roberto to provide a presentation with additional information.

=== Simplified UI for starting tests

Link: https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/17

* All UIs/web apps are expected to use the API. I.e., multiple UIs could be supported by
ETF and an administrator could select the UIs to use in a deployment. If multiple UIs
are supported, there could be links to switch the UI as needed. 
* Test Object Type detection is already implemented (see 
https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/83), but is currently mainly used
to validate that a submitted Test Object fits the selected ETSs, not to select ETSs for
a Test Object. However, most of the required capability should exist.
* If the "Simplified UI" for the INSPIRE Validator would be INSPIRE-specific, it should
not be part of ETF. If it is generic enough it should be part of ETF and would be useful
for others, too.

*Action:* JRC to review options based on the discussion.

== AOB

=== GDPR

*Action:* Add a privacy notice (based on the planned INSPIRE privacy notice, once a 
draft is available).

=== Meetings

For the next months we will use the first Tuesday of each month, i.e. 04/09/2018, 
02/10/2018, 06/11/2018, and 04/12/2018, at 10:00.

*Action:* Michael to send an invite.
