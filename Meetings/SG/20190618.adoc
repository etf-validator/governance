** SG discussed where Tags should be displayes in the test report view. 
For the requirements it is not clear whether a user wants to find reports
with a specific tag (which he did not necessarily start) or whether he only
wants to retrieve his reports. It is assumed that the latter is the case, but the requirement must be clarified.
** [ ] JRC to discuss with the subgroup and the contractors the exact requirement and how the UI could be changed.
** [ ] Contractors to change the text in the filter input to "Filter reports by title, date, tags" if the search field should be used with tags.
