## Status of ETF release

- ETF can be built from the sources but the Web Application Archive file built by the JRC contractors is slightly different in size (1 MB) from that of the [GitHub pipeline](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/runs/6587453322?check_suite_focus=true)
- in addition, the JRC contractors encounter a problem with missing JAR libraries but solved it by manually adding the libraries to the deployment. The issue might be related to the SoapUI test driver.
- the BaseX testdriver version 3 does not yet need to be shipped with the INSPIRE reference validator since the INSPIRE ETSs rely on the BaseX testdriver version 2. Once an ETS has been changed to use the version 3 test driver, it must be included. It is possible to use both testdrivers 2 & 3 in parallel.
- JRC plans to have the INSPIRE Reference validator based on ETF 2.1. will be in production in January 2023
- JRC proposes to make continuous releases at fixed intervals. The proposal will be discussed in the future after the release.
- SG confirmed to move on with the release
- [ ] JRC and contractors to add a note about the BaseX testdriver 2 and testdriver 3 in the documentation
- [ ] JRC and contractors to double check their build process
- [ ] JRC and contractors to check if the problem affects the SoapUI testdriver
- [x] Jon to create a changelog for the release (created [changelog in draft release](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/releases/tag/untagged-f69b83fada05d08467f0))

## HTTP/HTTPS redirection in ETF

- in the ETF version 2, the redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is no longer allowed in the schema validation components for security reasons 
- the HTTP redirection will not be deactivated in the next years by the INSPIRE registry and is essential for the INSPIRE ETSs
- SG agrees that forwarding should be configurable in ETF. The forwarding must only be allowed if the protocol changes, but the rest of the URL remains identical
- [x] JRC and contractors to create an EIP (created [EIP 116](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/116))

## EIPs for discussion/updates (if relevant)

- EIP [#77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77) and [#99](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/99): the project has been started and the EIPs will be updated at the end of the year
- [#100](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/100) EIP no updates
- [#108](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/108) EIP no updates
