where there are no news. These should be re-discussed at the next meeting in case there are news.

## EIPs for SG discussion

- [EIP #59](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/59)

  - the module is already developed and tested, and the idea is to include it in the next ETF release.
  - it is agreed to flag the EIP as _EIP-approved_ and move it under _TC: scheduled for release_ in the [EIP project board](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/2). The EIP will be included in the next release of the ETF.
  - [ ] ii to move the repository under the etf organisation.


- [EIP #57](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/57)

  - it is agreed to flag the EIP as _EIP-approved_ and move it under _TC: scheduled for release_ in the [EIP project board](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/2). The EIP will be included in the next release of the ETF.
  - the old version (v. 1) of the GmlGeoX module needs to be integrated with the new version of deegree, and this should be done in time for the next release.
  - [x] Contractors to create a [new EIP](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/96) to explain the approach.
  - [ ] Contractors to create the corresponding PR in the [etf-gmlgeox repo](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox).
  - once the approach is proven to work for v. 1 of GmlGeoX, in the future the same approach can be extended to v. 2 (again by first discussing the approach in a new EIP).
  - [ ] Contractors to create a new EIP (that can be initially just a draft) for the integration with v. 2 of GmlGeoX.


- [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)

  - progress is slow (also due to Covid-19) and there are no new developments.
  - ii to keep the SG informed on developments and plans.


## Status of open PRs and bug fixes for the release candidate

- All PRs have been accepted and merged, with the exception of [PR #217](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/217) to fix the bug on the Rerun button. The current fix does not work for persistent test objects.
  - a possile (easy) solution can be to pass to the UI the information whether the test object was a persistent or transient one, so that the Rerun button works ok for the use cases we have.


## ETF release plan & process

- Contractors were able to run the etf-result-checker tool and started testing with the INSPIRE conformance classes.

- There are two remaining issues to be fixed before the ETF release can happen:
  - integration of new deegree version in GmlGeoX (see above)
  - update PR #217 (see above)

- A schedule is agreed as follows:
  - the two remaining issues are fixed in the first two weeks of September
  - a RC is released on September 11
  - testing continues during the week of September 14-18
  - the ETF is released during the week of September 21-25

- The status and plan will be re-discussed in the next SG meeting.


## Governance of the webapp

- JRC is progressing well with the development of the new UI of the INSPIRE Reference Validator and plans to make it available to the community in September. This can be also tested against the ETF RC.



## AOB

- The etf-sg mailing list is now open to posts from non members.
- It is agreed to update the EIPs (GitHub issues) with the main content of the discussions held during the SG meetings, so that this can be easily found in the EIP pages without having to look at the minutes of all meetings. The minutes can then just include quick explanations and links to the new EIP comments.
- Next meeting: September 10, 2020 at 10:00 (rescheduled at 9:00)
  - [x] JRC to send an invitation
