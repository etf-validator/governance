## EIPs for SG discussion

- [#32](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32):
  - Update filter to also search for parameters `label` and `tag`.
  - The parameters `label` and `tag` will also be visible in the test report overview, if they are provided.
  - This requires only a change in the webapp.
  - [x] Approved, move to 'TC: analysis'
  - [ ] ii to provide an example for the use of parameters
  - [ ] TC to decide, if we should configure the parameters or use the convention (`label` and `tag` parameters)

- [#61](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61):
  - [Items 1+2](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61#issuecomment-481141656): The tests could be skipped using a parameter
  - [ ] ii to provide more details how to do this
  - [Item 3](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61#issuecomment-481141656): Agreed. This should be updated in ETF and become the default representation.
  - [ ] JRC to provide UI proposal
  
- [#67](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/67):
  - Discussion how useful a general solution is that is restricted to just the header/footer.
  - [ ] JRC will look into Server Side Includes (SSI) to check if this could address the requirements
  - Continue discussion in GitHub / in the next meeting
  
- [#70](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70):
  - The idea is to restructure the repositories to simplify updates. The module structure would basically stay as it is.

## Plan for automated tests for the next releases of ETS/ETF
