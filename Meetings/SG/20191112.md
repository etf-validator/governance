## Cleanup issue on the JRC Validator instance

- New input has been added in [WebApp #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208) on another problem that might be related. The problem has never occurred in staging, only in the production instance.
- [ ] Contractors will continue to investigate.
- [ ] ii will have a look at the log file and add feedback in the issue.

## CRS issue on GML validation

- Issues: [INSPIRE #60](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/ets-repository/issues/60), [INSPIRE #137](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/ets-repository/issues/137) and [GmlGeoX #20](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox/issues/20).
- This open issue that came up a few times in recent months in INSPIRE and should be fixed. It is not an issue in Germany as the coordinates use Easting/Northing.
- The preferred solution is to fix the bug in the deegree library.
- [ ] JRC will investigate how to fix the bug in the deegree library.

## Status of EIPs in draft (for updates)

- [#76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76): 
  - Contractors have updated the code and get an error that an operation is not supported in main memory.
  - [Â ] Contractors will update the issue.

- [#77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77): 
  - This draft EIP is expected to be addressed in 2020
  - [x] ii will update the EIP.

## Governance of the webapp

- JRC is working on a new interface, expected to be ready in a few months. 
- The user interface developed by ii for the German mapping agencies is expected to be published in a few months (after the project is complete).

## API Clients

- JRC asked workshop participants for any language preferences for API clients, but only received one response.
- ii reported that the AdV (German mapping agencies) expect that most invocations of their AdV-Testsuite will use the API, not the WebApp.
- ii has developed a Java ETF client library ([link](https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-client), work in progress) in an ongoing project related to the GDI-DE-Testsuite. In the future, the library could become part of ETF.
- JRC is discussing where the focus of the Reference Validator should be in the future (decentralised instances and/or a central instance). The use of the API is a relevant aspect of this discussion.
- Keep as an general item in the steering group agenda.

## Status of PRs for bug fixes

No changes from the previous meeting:

- [189](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/189):
  - [ ] Contractors to add automatic tests using Nightwatch, then inform the TC.
  
- [203](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/203): 
  - [ ] Contractors to add comments to the Codacy issues why these should be acceptable (e.g. through in-line comments so that a notification is sent to the TC), then the TC will review the PR.
  
- [206](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/206):
  - [ ] Contractors to provide a bugfix for [the issue](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/209) in a new PR.
  
## Plan for automated tests for the next releases of ETF

- The goal is to verify that existing ETSs still work or to identify which changes are needed to existing ETSs to migrate to a new release.
- ii talked to the AdV about providing reference ETSs/data/test results and will continue to work with them on this topic.
- JRC sees good use of validator by Member States and discusses the future strategy for releases of their staging / production environment. A request for reference data/test results for INSPIRE tests is an option.
- Contributed data should be open data so that it could be used in a public Continuous Integration environment.
- This is more complicated for web services, as any reference service should have high availability and may require a different approach as the service content is likely to change with time unless dedicated services for testing are set up and maintained.
- Discuss requirements and options in next meeting.
- [ ] JRC / ii to specify their requirements and ideas.
 
## AOB

- Feedback from Validator workshop and Validator webinar
  - Workshop materials were published by JRC and are available [here](https://github.com/inspire-eu-validation/community/tree/master/training%20material).
  - The GEOSS Webinar was quite general, no specific feedback to consider.
- List of existing ETF instances
  - INSPIRE has an outdated page: https://ies-svn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/2017-4/wiki/Known_ETF_instances
  - Would there be value in maintaining a list of known ETF instances (public or private) somewhere on https://etf-validator.net/?
  - [ ] ii to talk to users in Germany, if they are willing to share information about their instances.
- Next meetings: 
  - December 17 at 10:00, Webex invitation already shared.
  - January 21 at 10:00
  - February 18 at 10:00
  - [ ] JRC to share invitations for the dates in 2020.
