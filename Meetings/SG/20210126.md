  - [EIP #76](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/76)
  - [issue #208](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/208)
  - [EIP #100](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/100)
  - [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77)
  - [EIP #99](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/99)

## ETF release plan & process

- Issue with the GML invalid geometries ([issue #214](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/214))
  - A [PR](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-gmlgeox/pull/27) for [EIP #102](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/102) was created and merged.

- Hotfix due to a change in the OGC TEAM Engine
  - See [issue #447](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/issues/447) in the TEAM Engine repository.
  - The TEAM Engine will be updated with this fix in Q1 2021 (beta version) and in summer 2021 (production version).
  
- Status of testing with the [ETF release candidate](https://tc-2-1.etf.interactive-instruments.de/etf-webapp/#executable-test-suites) and schedule for the next release

  - [ ] Jon to include the latest PR on handling GML invalid geometries in the release candidate.

  - JRC tested the release candidate and spotted some inconsistencies when comparing the results with those from the production instance of the INSPIRE Validator. Some were already solved through communication before the meeting; the remaining ones are about services and are the following:
    - for **WMS** and **Atom**: from some quick tests, the reason of the inconsistencies is not clear but might be due to the http configuration of the release candidate instance. To understand whether this is actually the reason, it is decided to directly test the deployment of the release candidate in another local environment.
    - for **CSW**: the reason of the inconsistency is that the test is not reproducible (i.e. results of each test are different, as the request only asks for 10 metadata records). JRC will evaluate whether or not to change the test.
  
  - [X] Jon to share the updated ETF release candidate with the JRC.
  - [ ] JRC to test the ETF release candidate in a local environment and inform about the outcome of the same tests on WMS and Atom.

- AOB
  
  - The [call for participation in OGC Testbed-17](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=95726) includes [a topic on CITE](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=95726#Cite), which will look at the possible evolution of the TEAM Engine in light of the new API-based standards, in particular OGC API - processes. This could be a relevant activity to monitor given its link to the [EIP #77](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/77) on the new test driver for web service tests.

- Next meeting

  - February 23, 10am CET
  - [X] Marco to send an invitation.
