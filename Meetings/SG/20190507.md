## EIPs for SG discussion

- [#61](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61): 
  - Contractors provided [a mockup](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61#issuecomment-489718348), which does not fully correspond to the [description provided](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/61#issuecomment-481141656).
  - [ ] Contractors to provide a revised version of the mockup
  - Manual tests can be skipped using a parameter: parameters are defined in the ETS, then their values are passed as arguments when running tests (see [this example](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32#issuecomment-489603205) from ii)
  - A parameter `skipManualTests` can be used to allow skipping of manual tests
  - [x] ii to provide an example of how this might be done in XQuery

- [#67](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/67): 
  - JRC will work to customize the interface of the INSPIRE Validator
  - [x] It is agreed to close the EIP and remove it from the EIP project board
  - After the customization will be done, JRC will share the experience (to see if this example can be reused)
 
- [#70](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70):
  - [Feedback from Contractors](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/70#issuecomment-485779667) on the restructuring of the repository was positive
  - Changes will be implemented starting with the next release (2.1.0, foreseen for September 2019).

- [#71](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/71):
  - JRC confirms that there are currently no internal plans regarding Java editions, however JRC is using OpenJDK instead of Oracle.
  - ii highlights the need to support an additional test driver, since there is not much trust in the future of SoapUI
  - [ ] ii to open a dedicated EIP to start discussing on this
  
## EIPs in TC analysis

- [#31](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/31):
  - The [diagram](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/31#issuecomment-489681918) provided by Contractors is clear and allows to proceed with the implementation.
  - [x] It is agreed to change the label to 'EIP-approved' and move it to 'TC: in release planning'.

- [#32](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32):
  - ii provided an [explanation](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/32#issuecomment-489603205) on how parameters are defined and passed as arguments when running tests. This allows to proceed with the implementation.
  - It is agreed to move the EIP to 'TC: in release planning'.

- [#44](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/44):
  - Only minor performance improvements were found (4-5 seconds, which correspond to about a 10% improvement).
  - Discussion on identifying the bottleneck in the test execution: from experience, caching might only be useful when testing small metadata records (not datasets or services), which would be useful for the INSPIRE Geoportal.
  - [x] It is agreed to close the EIP and remove it from the EIP project board.
  - [ ] Jon to open a new EIP to share some insights on the BaseX option to use some in-memory database.

## Status of open PRs
  - PRs approved and merged: [#194](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/194), [#11](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-bsxds/pull/11) (etf-bsxds repository)
  - [ ] Contractors to make the requested changes to PR [#189](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/189)
  - [ ] A number of PRs have conflicts and need to be fixed by Contractors (code has to be updated with the latest code in the 'next' branch): [#193](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/193), [#196](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/196), [#199](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/pull/199), [#5](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-sui-ae/pull/5) (etf-sui-ae repository)
  - A solution for EIP [#30](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/30) was developed and included in the [cloud staging instance](http://staging-inspire-validator.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/etf-webapp/), however it seems not to work perfectly and needs some further checks.
  - [ ] Contractors to fix the code and provide a PR for this EIP.
  
## Plan for automated tests for the next releases of ETS/ETF

  - A [branch](https://github.com/guadaltel/etf-system-tests/tree/repo_organization) of the repository was created, and some content and initial structuring of folders/subfolders was proposed:
	- there is a folder _input data samples_ to store all the data used for testing
	- then there are different folders for each of the tools used, each one including: documentation on the tool, scripts used by the tool, and output data samples.
  - [ ] Contractors to start populating the folders/subfolders with examples (in particular for NightWatch), and submit a PR 
  - It is agreed not to open a new EIP for this topic, but to simply comment on the PR page.
  
## AOB

- Attention is placed on a long-standing [bug](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/187).
- [ ] Contractors to provide a PR to fix it.
- The abstract on the ETF/INSPIRE Validator was submitted for [FOSS4G 2019](https://2019.foss4g.org), now waiting to know if it is accepted.
- Next meeting: Tuesday, 18/06/2019 from 10:00 to 11:30.
