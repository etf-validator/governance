## Project boards

The current status of ETF Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and bug fixing can be tracked through these project boards:

* [ETF Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/2)
  * If you would like to discuss an idea before documenting a full EIP, simply create a new issue using the [EIP template](https://github.com/etf-validator/governance/issues/new/choose). Complete the template as far as possible and mention that this is not a complete proposal yet, but that you are looking for feedback. The ETF Steering Group members monitor the issues and will tag is as an "EIP-idea" and add it to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP". The Steering Group will move it to "SG: discussion" when ready for discussion by the Steering Group. If the Steering Group supports it, it will change the tag to "EIP",  move it back to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP" and ask you to complete the proposal.
  * Once an EIP is ready for approval, please indicate this in a comment to the issue and the Steering Group will move it to "SG: discussion". If the draft needs further updates, it will be moved back to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP" until all open questions are resolved.
* [Bug fixing](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/3)
  * If you would like to submit a bug report, please create a new issue in the etf-webapp repository using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/etf-validator/etf-webapp/issues/new/choose). The ETF Technical Committee members monitor the issues and will add them to bugfixing project board. If additional information is required, you will be contacted.
  * The Technical Committee will update the project board whenever the status of an issue changes.
  * Pull requests for bugfixes are very welcome (see "Contributing" below)!
