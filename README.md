## Terms of reference

* [Steering Group](TOR/Steering_Group.adoc)
* [Technical Committee](TOR/Technical_Committee.adoc)

## Project boards

The current status of ETF Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and bug fixing can be tracked through these project boards:

* [ETF Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/2)
  * If you would like to discuss an idea before documenting a full EIP, create an issue, tag is as an "EIP-idea" and add it to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP". Move it to "SG: discussion" when ready for discussion by the Steering Group. If the Steering Group supports it, it will change the tag to "EIP" and move it back to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP". 
  * Once an EIP is ready for approval, the proposer should move it (again, if it was an idea before) to "SG: discussion". If the draft needs further updates, it will be moved back to "Proposer: draft/refine EIP".
* [Bug fixing](https://github.com/orgs/etf-validator/projects/3)
