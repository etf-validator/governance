= Technical Committee Terms of Reference

Version 1.0.0, 30/5/2018

[[objectives]]
== *Objectives*

The main attributions of the Technical Committee (TC) are oriented to
guarantee the sustainability of the product from the technical point of
view, considering design, implementation and performance, in order to
help developers accomplish the roadmap of the product.

These objectives range from the establishment of development guidelines,
to the validation of proposals to incorporate the core source code into
the master branch, as well as to the analysis and design of structural
change actions in the source code of the application. Thus, the
following objectives are set out in more concrete terms:

* Governance of the Source Code Repository
* Answering to questions and issues
* Guiding Technical Development
* QC of Developments
* Product Technical Design
* Generate Releases

[[governance-of-the-source-code-repository]]
== Governance of the Source Code Repository

The SG is responsible for the ownership, management and administration
of the physical infrastructure that hosts the ETF source code. These
tasks are delegated to the TC:

* The acceptance of pull requests to the ETF source code.
* Administration of the source code repository, including user
management
* Management of templates and the mailing list

[[questions-and-issues]]
== Questions and issues

The TC will help with user and developer questions and issues on a best
effort basis. The TC is responsible for maintaining issue templates
in the Source Code Repository.

[[guiding-technical-development]]
== Guiding Technical Development

The TC will be in charge of providing the necessary directives and
instructions for the implementation of the developments by the Community
of ETF collaborators. For this purpose, the TC will provide the
Community with different elements for the development:.

* A getting started guide how contributions can be made
* Guidelines, which provide good practices like conventions, idioms and
patterns
* Quality Criteria that are checked if a Pull Request has been created

[[qc-of-developments]]
== QC of Developments

Quality Control of the code must be ensured to guarantee the
sustainability of ETF. Thus, the TC will produce a set of QC checkpoints
to be executed on the source code associated to a pull request, such as:

* Contribution agreement on file.
* Presence of tests.
* Presence of documentation
** for users, if changes introduce new features
** design decisions, if the software architecture is changed
* Presence of a proposal (only for new features).
* Copyright headers are present
* No commented out code sections.
* Javadocs and comments.
* Code formatting.
* English language is used in code and comments.
* Enhancements that provide special features to a small group of users
and are difficult to maintain may be rejected (TC voting and informing
SG is required). In this case, the TC could try to describe a solution,
how the enhancement can be maintained by the developer/organisation as
an extension module outside of the ETF repositories.
* Bugfix pull requests are available for all release versions that are
under maintenance.

Depending on the specific Quality Controls to be executed, this will be
performed on an automatic (Sonarqube or similar tools) or manual control
by the TC.

[[product-technical-design]]
== Product Technical Design

The TC shall take decisions concerning the technical design and
architecture of the product.

These decisions cover aspects such as module orientation, communication
interfaces, architecture, package refactoring, etc.

Any breaking changes (i.e. major versions) or design decisions that can
have major effects on others in the community (e.g. a proposal to
improve usability even if this would mean performance losses) require an
approval by the SG.

For minor design decisions where only feedback by the SG might be
desired, the TC may invite interested SG members to a discussion or
voting (mail, gitter, web meeting). The primary or secondary SG
representative should react within 3 days. Not submitting a vote is
considered as silent approval.

[[generate-releases]]
== Generate Releases

The TC will be responsible for compiling all the functionalities
associated with a specific release, generating it, testing it and,
finally, publishing it in the different repositories so that it can be
used by the Community.

To this end, the use of a continuous integration environment is
recommended to allow the TC to carry out these and other tasks as
efficiently as possible.

[[tc-membership]]
== TC Membership

The process of obtaining TC membership is based on proven technical
capacity.

This capacity will be demonstrated over time by the implementation of
several pull-requests for their incorporation into ETF.

The TC will analyze these pull-requests prior to their incorporation
into the source code. If these requests are deep enough to demonstrate
knowledge and mastery of ETF, this person may be incorporated into the
TC.

The SG will assess and accept/reject new TC members proposal.

A TC member must be active. If no activity can be determined for 4
months, the other TC members can request the SG to remove the inactive
member from the TC.

Inaugural members are:

* â€¦

[[assets-to-be-maintained]]
== Assets to be maintained

The assets that the committee has to produce and maintain in order to
establish the main lines of the ETF development for the Community are
the following:

* Mailing list
* The Source Code Repository issue template
* The Source Code Repository contribution file containing
* A reference to the CLA (maintained by the SG)
* A reference to the Code of conduct (maintained by the SG)
* Development Guidelines
* Quality Control Criteria
* Releases
* Template for submission of proposals
